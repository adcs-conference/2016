<h1 id="submissions">Submissions</h1>
<p>Submissions should comply with the paper guidelines set out below. All
submissions must be original work, not previously published elsewhere, and not
currently submitted to any other conference or journal.</p>

<p><strong>Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the symposium to present the work.</strong> Note also that it is insufficient for an author to register for the symposium to be regarded as fulfilling this obligation.</p>
<p>All submissions will be subject to a double blind peer reviewing process. Please ensure that any identifying information is removed from all submissions (such as author names, references to unpublished work, or citations such as &quot;In [3], we ...&quot;) to ensure that the authors remain anonymous.</p>
<h2 id="full-papers">Full papers</h2>
<p>Full papers should describe new contributions or analyse research issues. Submissions should be at most eight pages long (around 3000 words); over-length submissions risk immediate rejection. Refer to the paper guidelines below for details of the required format.</p>
<h2 id="posters-short-papers-and-industry-status-reports">Posters, short papers and industry status reports</h2>
<p>To encourage participation by industry and to provide a place for work of a more speculative nature, ADCS invites submissions for short papers, up to a maximum of four pages (around 1500 words). A typical proposal might describe a leading-edge solution to a practical problem in document management or search. Short papers should follow the same format as for full papers.</p>
<p>Presentation of short papers will be via a poster session. Accepted short papers will also be included in a separate section of the symposium proceedings.</p>
<h2 id="submission-system">Submission System</h2>
<p>Full and short papers are to be submitting using easychair using the URL: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adcs2016" class="uri">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adcs2016</a>.</p>
<h1 id="paper-guidelines">Paper Guidelines</h1>
<p>Please use the Latex or Word template files which are available on the <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">ACM templates page</a>.</p>
<p>Submissions of full-length papers should be a maximum of eight pages in the required style (approximately 3000 words).</p>
<p>Submissions for Posters, Short papers, Industry Status Reports, and Demonstrations (if any of the above) should be a maximum of four pages in the required style (appoximately 1500 words).</p>
<p>All submitted papers should include abstract, keywords and should apply ACM Computing Classification categories and terms. The templates provide space for this indexing and point authors to the <a href="http://www.acm.org/about/class/1998">Computing Classification Scheme</a>.</p>
<p>All submissions must be original work, not previously published elsewhere, and not currently submitted to any other conference or journal.</p>
<p>Submissions that differ markedly in length or style from these guidelines risk being rejected without further consideration.</p>

# Poster Instructions

Posters should be A0 (portrait orientation only) or A1 (portrait or
landscape) size.

Please note that there are no poster printing facilities at the
conference venue. However, if you don't want to travel with your poster,
there are professional printing services nearby (for example,
[Dinkums](http://www.dinkums.com.au/) on Swanston St) but these will of
course charge you a fee.
